You can clone or download this repo. Once you have done so, from the root
directory of the repo, run:

    npm install
    npm start

I have written unit tests for all code using mocha and chai. Once local webserver is running, test results can be viewed at: 
[http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

Unit Tests can also be invoked from the command line of the project root:

    npm test

Main code file is located in app/code.js
